## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to streamline the microprocessor verification process by developing a Python script capable of automating testbench generation from assembly programs. Manual testbench creation for complex microprocessors can be time-consuming and error-prone, hindering development efficiency. By automating this process, the project aims to significantly reduce development time and enhance productivity. The microprocessor's 5-stage pipeline architecture divides instruction execution into discrete stages: **Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-Back**. This approach facilitates concurrent instruction processing, thereby improving throughput. Leveraging the advantages of the MIPS 32 architecture, the project aims to create a comprehensive solution for microprocessor verification.

## Features

- **32-bit processor**: Processor contain 32 32-bit wide registers and each instruction is 32-bit.
- **5 Stage pipeline**: Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-Back.
- **Custom Instruction Set**: 24 6-bit custom instruction set.
- **Error Detection**: The script is able to detect errors in input assebly file.

## Installation

To install the Automatic Test Bench Generation tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Nidhinchandran47/MIPS_testbench_generator.git
    cd MIPS_testbench_generator
    ```

2. **Set up the environment:**

    Ensure that you have the necessary tools and compilers for hardware description languages (Verilog) installed on your system.

## Usage

Using the Automatic Test Bench Generation tool is straightforward. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Open the MIPS HDL in complier**

2. **Run the tool:**

    ```sh
    python script.py
    ```
    Enter the assembly file name with txt extention.

3. **Review and use the generated test benches** in your verification process.
   The script will shoe if errors are there in the input, else provide the testbench. Copy it to the compiler and simulate.
