# TESTBENCH AUTOMATION ON A MIPS-BASED MICROPROCESSOR IMPLEMENTED IN VERILOG

Welcome to my B.Tech Major project! This tool is designed to automate the creation of test benches for a custom designed MIPS processors for a given assembly file. 

> ðŸš¨ " THE GENERATED TESTBENCH IS NOT FOR *FULL FUNCTIONALTY VERIFICATION*, FOR A GIVEN ASSEMBLY CODE -> IT GENERATE A TESTBENCH TO RUN THAT ASSEMBLY CODE IN THIS MIPS PROCESSOR"

## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to streamline the microprocessor verification process by developing a Python script capable of automating testbench generation from assembly programs. Manual testbench creation for complex microprocessors can be time-consuming and error-prone, hindering development efficiency. By automating this process, the project aims to significantly reduce development time and enhance productivity. The microprocessor's 5-stage pipeline architecture divides instruction execution into discrete stages: **Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-Back**. This approach facilitates concurrent instruction processing, thereby improving throughput. Leveraging the advantages of the MIPS 32 architecture, the project aims to create a comprehensive solution for microprocessor verification.

## Features

- **32-bit processor**: Processor contain 32 32bit wide registers and each instruction is 32 bit.
- **5 Stage pipeline**: Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-Back.
- **Custom Instruction Set**: 24 6 bit custom instruction set.
- **Error Detection**: The script is able to detect errors in input assebly file.

## Installation

To install the Automatic Test Bench Generation tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-test-bench-generation.git
    cd automatic-test-bench-generation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the environment:**

    Ensure that you have the necessary tools and compilers for hardware description languages (VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog) installed on your system.

## Usage

Using the Automatic Test Bench Generation tool is straightforward. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Prepare your design specifications and test scenarios.**

2. **Run the tool:**

    ```sh
    python generate_test_bench.py --input <design_file> --output <output_directory> --language <hdl_language> --config <config_file>
    ```

    - `--input`: Path to the hardware design file.
    - `--output`: Directory where the generated test bench files will be saved.
    - `--language`: Hardware description language (vhdl, verilog, systemverilog).
    - `--config`: Path to the configuration file (optional).

3. **Review and use the generated test benches** in your verification process.

## Configuration

The tool can be configured using a configuration file in JSON or YAML format. The configuration file allows you to specify various options, such as signal definitions, clock settings, and test scenarios.

Example configuration file (config.json):

```json
{
    "clock_signal": "clk",
    "reset_signal": "rst",
    "test_scenarios": [
        {
            "name": "basic_functionality",
            "stimuli": [
                {"signal": "input1", "value": "0b0010", "time": 10},
                {"signal": "input2", "value": "0b1100", "time": 20}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
