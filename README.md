## Introduction

In hardware design, creating test benches manually can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. The Automatic Test Bench Generation tool addresses this by automating the generation of test benches based on the design specifications and test scenarios. This not only accelerates the verification process but also improves the reliability of the tests.

## Features

- **Automated Test Bench Creation**: Generate test benches automatically from hardware design specifications.
- **Customization Options**: Flexible configuration to accommodate various testing scenarios and requirements.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Generate test benches in VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Easily integrate with continuous integration and delivery pipelines to automate testing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Installation

To install the Automatic Test Bench Generation tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-test-bench-generation.git
    cd automatic-test-bench-generation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the environment:**

    Ensure that you have the necessary tools and compilers for hardware description languages (VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog) installed on your system.

## Usage

Using the Automatic Test Bench Generation tool is straightforward. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Prepare your design specifications and test scenarios.**

2. **Run the tool:**

    ```sh
    python generate_test_bench.py --input <design_file> --output <output_directory> --language <hdl_language> --config <config_file>
    ```

    - `--input`: Path to the hardware design file.
    - `--output`: Directory where the generated test bench files will be saved.
    - `--language`: Hardware description language (vhdl, verilog, systemverilog).
    - `--config`: Path to the configuration file (optional).

3. **Review and use the generated test benches** in your verification process.

## Configuration

The tool can be configured using a configuration file in JSON or YAML format. The configuration file allows you to specify various options, such as signal definitions, clock settings, and test scenarios.

Example configuration file (config.json):

```json
{
    "clock_signal": "clk",
    "reset_signal": "rst",
    "test_scenarios": [
        {
            "name": "basic_functionality",
            "stimuli": [
                {"signal": "input1", "value": "0b0010", "time": 10},
                {"signal": "input2", "value": "0b1100", "time": 20}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
